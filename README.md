        "include": True,
        "action": "payment_successful",
        "operation": "sum",
        "property": "price",
        "condition": ">=",
        "value": 10000,  # ₹10,000+ lifetime value
        "timeframe": 365,
        "logic": "AND"
    },
    {
        "include": False,
        "action": "payment_successful",
        "operation": "count",
        "property": "events",
        "condition": ">=",
        "value": 1,
        "timeframe": 90,  # No purchase in last 90 days
        "logic": None
    }
]

system.create_cohort(
